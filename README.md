# Decision Tree Classifier Applied on COVID-19 Dataset

## Project Overview

COVID-19, caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, poses a global threat with severe respiratory implications. Early detection is crucial, considering the virus's contagiousness and potential fatality. Timely identification is vital for prompt treatment and preventing complications. While existing tests are available, they can be expensive and time-consuming. This project addresses these challenges by developing a machine learning model. Leveraging patient symptoms, age, and medical history, the model predicts infection with high precision. Trained on a dataset from the Mexican government, it includes anonymized patient information, including pre-conditions.

## Background and Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for effective and efficient diagnostic tools. Traditional testing methods can be slow and costly. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a model that can predict COVID-19 infection based on readily available patient data. By improving early detection, the model could help in managing and mitigating the spread of the virus more effectively.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Mexican government and includes anonymized patient information. It consists of features such as patient age, symptoms, and medical history. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values and to standardize feature scales.

## Project Structure

- **Datasets/**: Contains the dataset files used for training and testing the models.
- **notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis, model training, evaluation, and results visualization.
- **Results/**: Contains the output files such as results and plots generated by the notebook.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate classification models to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection based on various medical features.

## Models Used

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A decision tree algorithm used for classification.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model for binary classification.

## Resampling Methods

- **SMOTE**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
- **BorderlineSMOTE**: A variant of SMOTE for handling borderline cases
- **RandomOverSampler**: A method for oversampling the minority class
- **ADASYN**: Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach
- **SMOTEENN**: A combination of SMOTE and Edited Nearest Neighbors

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy Score**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Balanced Accuracy Score**: The average of recall obtained on each class, which accounts for class imbalance.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: The ability of the model to correctly identify positive cases.
- **Specificity**: The ability of the model to correctly identify negative cases.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
